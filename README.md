RosalindCommon
==============

RosalindCommon is the Mono library which aims to provide various helpers for solving
Rosalind problems, like the FASTA format parser, so that you can get to the heart of
the problem and don't reinvent the bicycle.

Note: there are NO answers to ANY of Rosalind problems here. It'd be unfair and 
it's prohibited by the rules.
